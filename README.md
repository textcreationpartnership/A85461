    _ Verſ. 16. Confeſſe your faults one unto another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed; the effectuall fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

      * Namely that yee may be healed.

    _ Verſ. 17. Elias was a man ſubject to like paſſions as wee are, &c.

      * The ſecond point is the state and condition of the party inſtanced in, together with the conſimilitude, that is, ſubject to paſſions as we are.

      * By the nature of theſe ſufferings we know of what ſpirit and power, of what nature, vertue, and comprehenſion this act of Eliah is, which is the third point; And hee prayed.
